            <p class="description">My name is Vivine Mutoni am Rwandan living in kigali city,
                i did physics chemistry and biology back in 2014 in secondary school.
                After finishing up my highschool i joined in WfP(world food program)in 2015 as a store manager for
                4years
                in Mahama refugee camp i can say that it was a very great experience working in that area!
                so after my contract ended ,back in 2019 i joined Royal associates insurance brokers for 6months.
                I can say that was my working experience ,but after that i joined college in Agriculture and business
                but unfortunately this covid19 came through.

                Well about my hobbies: <br>i love listening to music very much,<br> Travelling like discovering new
                places and
                things <br>love eating sooo much,<br> playing with kids in my free time, <br>watching movies,<br>reading
                some books,<br>
                and i also love cleaning especially dishes.
            </p>
            <p>The reason why i joined programming lessons is because i have always wanted to learn how its done
                but importantly was making my fellow young women to believe themselves,since back in the days men were
                the only ones
                who were in this field. and i have found out that doing this course will improve my level of not giving
                up when something
                does not work out but rather than begin again.
            <P>skills: i have communication skills, am a good cook, leadership, computer skills ,
                logistics skills.
            </P>
